Home-library

Home library is a simple application that allows to create a list of books included in your own library with their characteristics. Data made by adding and editing positions are saved in books.json file.

To use application you need to download the content of repository and go to main folder. Next open file app.py in a code editor and run the script. Then open the browser and go to http://localhost:5000/book/ which is the main page of application. 

The main page contains a list of books and offer a possibility of adding new positions and editing the existing one. The sample data are given in attached json file, if it isn't needed it can be removed from folder (if appplication wouldn't find books.json file it will return an empty list). By using an edit option you're able to reviev and rate books on a ten-point scale. To display added reviev on a main page you need to check "Czy przeczytane" checkbox. In case of adding a cover of a book, you need to input a JPEG or PNG format of file.

The versions of used languages and libraries are contained in requirements.txt file.
